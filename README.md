This tool helps you unsubscribe from Github repos managed by an organisation with
namespace diarrhoea; it leaves you subscribed to the repos you explicitly watched,
but reverts the annoying autosubscriptions to new repos created by other members
of your organisation

Usage:

  $ unwatch-org username password organisationname
